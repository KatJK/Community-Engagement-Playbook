# Go where the stakeholders are

* Attend community meetings and events, such as farmers markets, festivals and sporting events
* Roundtable, town hall, forum-it doesnâ€™t matter what you call it. Hold public meetings in various parts of the city, at different times of the day. Plan the meetings so that they are interactive, and encourage participants to work with one another and [actively participate](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/community-participation).
* Consider reaching out to private companies, and seeing what data they need to provide better services. How can data be integrated into their products?
* Contact [local universities](http://innovation.unt.edu/) that may have student service learning projects, researchers interested in community data, or a desire to incubate start ups and encourage innovation. Ask what problems they are trying to solve, or what data they may need.
* Reach out to local community groups, and nonprofit service providers to ask for their city data needs.
