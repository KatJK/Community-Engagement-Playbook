# 1. **Define the purpose and scope of stakeholder participation**
Begin by determining what you hope to achieve by public participation. 
Generally, cities are interested in getting data and information in the hands of residents, who can use it to [stay informed](http://gis.aurora-il.org/myplace/) and make decisions.  In addition to consuming the data, residents can create [tools of their own](http://votedenton.org/) to solve civic problems once the data is made available.
 
GovEx has identified three such purposes:
* Public interacts and engages with data apps and visualization tools
* Public creates innovative tools from raw data
* Public co-produced policy and open data prioritization with the city
* City uses data to target policies or programs to improve residents lives

For each purpose, think about the scope of stakeholder participation that you would like to achieve, and the stage of the program. Are you hoping to design a new policy or program by committee? Would you prefer to give the community something to respond to? Are you soliciting feedback for a pilot tool, or are you ready to launch and cultivate users?
